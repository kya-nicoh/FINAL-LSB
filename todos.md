TODO
- save image and .txt to firebase
- verify last signature button

- change save name of generated images to [email]-[timedate_created] -> do same with .txt



IDEAS
- per account signatures saved into firebase, naming is [email]-[timedate_created]
- per account one folder full of signatures generated
